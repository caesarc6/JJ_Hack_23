# JJ_Hack_23
hackathon '23 submission

Project name: Clear Air

What it does:

Our web application is specifically made so that anyone with respiratory health issues or allergies can check on a live status update on how safe it is for them to be able to travel outside. There are multiple factors we take in to calculate the AQI 'or Air Quality Index' and that is Ozone and Particulate matter. We can then calculate on a Good, Moderate, or Bad scale with each to their respective colors to let users know how safe it actually is for them.

How we built it:

We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front-end. MaterialUI allowed us to pick colors/designs for our UI. The React library was used to organize our code into separate components. As for the back-end functionality, understanding how AJAX works was essential to working with APIs.

Challenges we ran into:

It was difficult to connect the purpose of our project to the theme of social change until we dug deeper into the impacts of air pollution on a larger scale.
