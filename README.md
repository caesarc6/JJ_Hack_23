Our web application is specifically made so that anyone with respiratory health issues or allergies can check on a live status update on how safe it is for them to be able to travel outside. There are multiple factors we take in to calculate the AQI 'or Air Quality Index' and that is Ozone and Particulate matter. We can then calculate on a Good, Moderate, or Bad scale with each to their respective colors to let users know how safe it actually is for them.

This was built using: Javascript, MaterialUI, React, Vite.js, and the WeatherbitAPI.
